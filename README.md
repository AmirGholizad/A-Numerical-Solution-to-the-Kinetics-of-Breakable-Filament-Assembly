# Some informations about this project named A Numerical Solution to the Kinetics of Breakable Filament Assembly

We presented a numerical treatment of a set of coupled kinetic equations that govern the self-assembly of filamentous molecular structures.

There is an article between files which was the footstone of our project. We used the same ODEs were written in this article and then we applied the numerical treatments to solve them.
For doing the numerical simulation and visualizations we used the Maple software. Maple could be a little bit slow for running complicated codes and loops, but for doing numerical stuff it was very useful for me. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't understand maple codes but you can download the codes and run it with any version of maple. By doing this you can see the codes, charts, and other results. Feel free to inform me if you faced any trouble with downloading or compiling the codes.
